# Teamfight Tactics: Galaxies
React App Project

## Notes on React Apps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; React was created for efficiency by running web apps purely with
javascript. In addition, states are used in a single page application, allowing for changes to be made
on a component by component basis instead of reloading the entire page. States automagically reflects
the changes on the webpage where relevant when they are updated. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many built-in functions that facilitate the use of this
library and the development of web applications. Also, by nature, react apps are easily modularized,
allowing for organzation and scalability.

## Motive & Action
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project revolves around the third season of Teamfight Tactics,
a game from a genre that is aptly named "Autochess". The website will feature four sections: an About 
section, that introduces the game, a Champions section, that shows a list of champions that can be
filtered by origin and class, an Items section, that shows a list of all core and fusable items with their
descriptions, and a Galaxies sections, that shows the different modes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionaly, Champion cards can be clicked to reveal more info and
all thumbnail items (Origins & Classes in Champions page and Core items & Fusable items in Items page)
have an onHover feature that reveals more info about the respective subject.
